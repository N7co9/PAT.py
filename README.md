# Wizard101-PetAutomationTool

small scale python project utilizing pyautogui, pillow and opencv to catch and repeat the sequence from the dance game in pet pavilion.

CURRENT ISSUE / KNOWN BUGS:
- messy code.
- only works with first level at the moment.
- stricter SOLID compliance needed / bad readability.
- only works with a single entry: meaning that you can only execute the script, when you stand infront of the mini game
- and the dance game popup occurs. multiple entries e.g. when already in the loading screen or level select needed.

COMING SOON / TO-DO:
- user friendly GUI.
- requirements pre-install.
- click & forget.
- testing.

## Installation

clone the src code and run the app.py script - requires pip and python
```bash
cd into directory
pip install requirements.txt
./app.py
```
